Project's goal was to develop a mobile application that aimed to unravel and simplify the day to day complications faced
by a visually impaired individual and as well as assist an aware individual.
The original idea came from Cortana, Siri and other Artificial Intelligence.

The only way a visually impaired person can communicate is via VOICE,
keeping that in mind we implemented an intelligent voice recognition assistant for android where functionality for an individualâ€™s
day to day chores are simplified.
